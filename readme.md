hi there
it's the very first time of mine
i dont know how to change this file by git command 
:(

but now i do know!!!!

and now I really know

5:09PM I'm trying on my Window computer. Hope it works! 
5:18PM Using Cmd S to save this line and it works! But I dunno how to close
5:24PM To close this I use cmd X :)) 
9:13PM After push the file to github, you have to pull it back to receive the latest update.
just enter git pull in the working directory
in Mac, use control X to close nano
